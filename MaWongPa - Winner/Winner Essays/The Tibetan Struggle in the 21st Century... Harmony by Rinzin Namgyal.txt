and Social Harmony.

In this essay, I set out my personal perspective on sustaining the Tibetan movement in the 21st 
century. As Xi Jinping himself has noted, “we are witnessing changes unseen in a century.” 
Yet, as Sun Tzu observed, “In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.” Xi’s era, and the 
inevitable post-Xi transition, represents a critical juncture: fraught with challenges, yet 
brimming with possibilities. China’s rise brings growing responsibilities and mounting 
vulnerabilities. According to Doran’s Power Cycle Theory, every great power peaks before it 
declines. I believe China will reach its zenith under President Xi Jinping, followed by decline, 
creating an opportunity for Tibetans to strengthen diplomacy and global advocacy. Xi’s extreme 
centralisation and ideological rigidity also create cracks we must exploit. China’s moments of 
weakness provide an optimal environment for Tibetans to advance diplomatic coalitions and 
press for a place at the negotiating table. 

To sustain our struggle, I propose three imperatives based on my understanding: first, 
cultivating deep expertise in Chinese studies; second, fostering a harmonious relationship 
between religion and politics; and third, forging unity and strategic coordination across the 
Tibetan movement. 

 

1. Decoding the Dragon: Why Tibetans Must Master Chinese Political Thought. 

Firstly, cultivating robust scholarship in Chinese Studies is imperative for sustaining the 
Tibetan movement in the 21st century. As Sun Tzu aptly stated in The Art of War, “Know your 
enemy and know yourself, and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster.” To effectively 
navigate the challenges posed by the Chinese state, it is vital that we develop an intimate and 
nuanced understanding of our adversary—something only attainable through rigorous and 
comprehensive engagement with Chinese Studies.  

China is a vast civilisation with a complex and layered history. In the modern era, it is also an 
ideologically driven state, producing its own unique theoretical frameworks under the auspices 
of the Chinese Communist Party. Concepts such as consultative democracy, state-led 
capitalism, high-quality development, Beautiful China, and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism 
with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era are not mere slogans but are deeply embedded in 
governance, policymaking, and statecraft. Likewise, phrases such as Three Consciousnesses (

三种意识), pomegranate seeds (石榴籽), the two safeguards (两个维护), seven up, eight down 

(七上八下), bull's nose (牛鼻子), and big family (大家庭) are not just political catchphrases—

they represent coded language, signalling deeper ideological and strategic postures of the Party-
State.  



Without a solid grounding in China’s domestic politics and political discourse, one cannot 
properly comprehend Beijing’s governance model or its policies on Tibet, let alone respond 
effectively. By Chinese Studies, I mean a broad discipline covering domestic governance, 
history, foreign policy, inter-party relations, economic systems, ethnic policy, language, and 
the CCP’s shifting ideological apparatus. 

Supporting and expanding opportunities for Tibetan students to specialise in Chinese Studies 
is not a luxury, but a necessity. We must establish dedicated scholarships for Tibetan scholars 
in this field, and regularly convene conferences focused solely on China, with Tibetan thinkers 
and participants at the forefront. At present, much of Tibetan literature on China remains 
framed predominantly through a colonial lens. While this critique is valid, relying solely upon 
it risks narrowing our analytical capacity, limiting the sophistication of both present and future 
policies. 

That said, understanding Communist Party of China CPC is a formidable task. I often call it 
one of the "greatest intellectual challenges of the 21st century." Yet we must start 
somewhere. A practical beginning could involve scholarships targeted at Tibetan students of 
Chinese Studies, Tibet-focused conferences on China, and the gradual introduction of Chinese 
language instruction as a non-credit subject — alongside Tibetan and English — at least twice 
a month in our Sambhota schools. Such careful yet strategic steps will, over time, build a cadre 
of Tibetan thinkers with the tools to engage China on its own terms. 

 

2. Democracy with Tibetan Characteristics: Reimagining Religion and Politics. 

In today’s exile Tibetan community, the intersection of politics and religion — often 
manifesting as regionalism and sectarianism — has become a major fault line, particularly in 
an era of growing digitalisation. Some argue for the separation of religion and politics, a notion 
rooted in Europe’s specific historical trajectory. Yet the Tibetan context demands nuance 
interpretation. What exactly does separation mean here? Does it imply barring revered monks, 
democratically elected by their religious constituencies, from Parliament? That is not genuine 
separation, but rather the silencing of religious voices in public life. 

In a profoundly spiritual society like Tibetan society, religion is not merely institutional; it is 
the very fabric of our cultural and ethical world. The influence of Buddhist principles shapes 
the lives, choices, and moral compass of lay representatives and parliamentarians alike. So, 
how can one truly separate religion and politics in such a context? Their values, conduct, and 
policies are inseparable from Buddhist upbringing. As Dr Gyalo, a Tibetan educational 
sociologist, observes, spirituality drives social change in Tibetan society; any reform must 
begin with Buddhist institutions and spread into the social sphere (Jia Luo, 2015). 

Thus, rather than chasing rigid separation, the real question is: How can we foster a more 
harmonious relationship between religion and politics in the Tibetan polity?  Only by 
integrating our spiritual heritage with modern governance can we unify our fractured 
community and curb sectarianism and regionalism. In doing so, we create a unique, indigenous 
model — a “Democracy with Tibetan Characteristics” Such a model, rooted in both ethical 



Buddhist traditions and democratic principles, would offer a powerful alternative to imported 
Western political systems, while also strengthening the coherence of our movement. How can 
we foster a more harmonious relationship between religion and politics in the Tibetan polity? 
is the question of today’s Tibet we must all seek answer.  

 

3. Forging Unity in Diversity: The Case for a Coordinated Tibetan Movement.  

Chanakya once advised, “Before you start some work, always ask yourself three questions – 
Why am I doing it, What might the results be, and Will I succeed? Only when you have 
satisfactory answers, go ahead.” I invoke this wisdom when reflecting on the fragmented 
Tibetan movement in today’s hyper-digitalised world. Many rights groups and passionate 
Tibetans pursue disparate ideologies and objectives under the Tibetan cause. While this 
advocacy is laudable, there is an urgent need for a shared foundation and a unifying strategic 
vision. As the late Gyari Rinpoche observed, the lack of coordination among Tibetan actors has 
been a principal obstacle in advancing the Sino-Tibetan dialogue, despite broader geopolitical 
challenges. 

While some argue that divergent views are natural in a democracy, the harsh reality of 
asymmetrical power demands pragmatism. Without a consolidated front, our capacity to 
negotiate or exert leverage remains minimal. What the movement needs now is a fusion of 
popular appeal and strategic clarity. This clarity — in both message and intent — must come 
not only from the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) but from all parts of our political and 
civil institutions, rights groups, and regional associations. Only then can we forge a collective 
voice — one people, one aspiration — clearly recognised by the international community and 
the Chinese state. 

Such coherence strengthens our long-term position and the effectiveness of immediate 
engagements, especially with audiences unfamiliar with Tibetan intricacies. Yet in the current 
geopolitical climate, even the Middle Way Approach appears increasingly remote. I recall 
asking Professor Wu Guoguang, a Chinese-American scholar and former aide to Zhao Ziyang, 
about the Middle Way Approach. He acknowledged its merits but stated bluntly: “The CCP 
will never share power.” Power remains the fundamental barrier in Sino-Tibetan relations. 

Given this, we must critically reassess the CCP’s power structures, contradictions, and 
limitations. Hosting targeted conferences, fostering rigorous analysis, and deepening 
scholarship on CCP politics are essential. Tibetan groups in exile, alongside the CTA, should 
also advocate for the revival of civil society within Tibet as an immediate priority. Even a 
modest revival can uphold accountability for the Chinese bureaucracy, bolster resilience among 
citizens, and enhance the movement’s legitimacy in the eyes of the world, despite the 
formidable challenges under Xi’s China.  

Conclusion: 

These three variables—the pursuit of a coordinated movement, the cultivation of rigorous 
Chinese studies, and the integration of religion and politics in a harmonious framework—must 



be actively examined and put into practice in the years ahead. In my view as a student, they 
could well prove the most potent instruments for sustaining the Tibetan cause throughout the 
21st century and beyond the era of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama.
