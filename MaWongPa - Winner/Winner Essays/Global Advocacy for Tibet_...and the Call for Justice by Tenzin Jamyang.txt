GLOBAL ADVOCACY FOR TIBET: A REFUGEE'S REFLECTION ON IDENTITY, RESISTANCE AND THE CALL FOR JUSTICE. 

"བོད་མི་འབྱོར་བ་མེད། ང་ཚོས་བོད་སྐྱོན་མེད་ན།" (Tibet is not lost unless we forget it); these words echo in my heart like a sacred mantra steady, unyielding and alive. They are not just a reminder, but a call to action. A people may be displaced, a land may be occupied but, a nation is never truly lost as long as its memory is carried with love and its name is spoken with purpose. In the stillness of exile, this mantra becomes my compass. It fuels my will to write, to speak and to act not just for the Tibet I inherited through stories, but for the Tibet that lives on in resistance, in culture and in the silent prayers of its children.
      Growing up as a Tibetan refugee in India, I have always felt the silent echo of a homeland I have never seen. My parents fled Tibet in the aftermath of the 1959 uprising, carrying nothing but memories and scars and planting our roots in the foreign yet welcoming soil of India. While I was born and raised here, my spirit has always been tethered to Tibet; an invisible umbilical cord that connects me to its mountains, monasteries and martyrdoms. The ongoing struggle for Tibet is not merely a political issue; it is a human one. It is about a people's right to dignity, identity and existence. Global advocacy for Tibet is not just a matter of solidarity, it is a moral imperative. From my earliest years in the Tibetan settlements of India, I was taught not just the Tibetan language and culture but also the narrative of exile and loss. We lived in homes that were both havens and reminders, safe yet saturated with the pain of displacement. I remember how elders spoke in hushed tones about relatives who had disappeared, about monasteries reduced to rubble, about an occupied homeland transformed beyond recognition. And I remember too, the strength with which they chanted prayers, not with despair, but with quiet resilience. Their longing was not passive, it was fuel for resistance.
      As a Tibetan in exile, I often wrestle with a complex identity. I am Indian by circumstance, Tibetan by blood and global by the necessity of my struggle. I have grown up in a democratic society that cherishes freedom and yet, every day I carry the weight of a people denied their basic rights. This contradiction compels me to speak, write and advocate; not just for my own sense of justice, but for the millions who suffer in silence within the walls of Chinese authoritarianism. My voice may be small, but it carries the echoes of my ancestors and that makes it powerful.
      Global advocacy for Tibet must be rooted in the acknowledgment of an uncomfortable truth: the world has largely chosen to remain indifferent to our suffering. The economic and geopolitical rise of China has muted the conscience of many democratic nations, reducing their responses to mere lip service. Tibet has become a taboo word in diplomatic circles, an issue sidelined for the sake of trade deals and strategic alliances. As an exile, I do not have the luxury of such compromises. For me, Tibet is not a political inconvenience; it is a burning wound, a sacred cause. However, we Tibetans are not merely victims; we are survivors and torchbearers of a unique spiritual and cultural heritage. The Tibetan cause is not just about political sovereignty; it is about the survival of an ancient civilization. Under Chinese rule, Tibet has suffered not just physical occupation, but a brutal campaign of cultural erasure. Monasteries have been destroyed, language policies have marginalized our mother tongue and surveillance has criminalized basic expressions of faith and identity. The world must understand that when a language dies, a worldview dies with it. When a culture is suppressed, humanity loses a piece of its soul. Despite these grim realities, there is hope, sustained not by external governments but by the indomitable will of the Tibetan people and the solidarity of a few brave hearts around the world. The global Tibetan movement, though small, is deeply rooted in nonviolence and compassion. Inspired by His Holiness the XIV Dalai Lama, our struggle has always rejected violence as a means of resistance. This moral clarity has been our strength, but also, perhaps, a reason why the world often overlooks our plight. In a world addicted to dramatic headlines and violent upheavals, our peaceful persistence doesn't always make the news. Yet it is precisely this steadfastness that should inspire the world to act.
      As an exile, I have come to understand that advocacy for Tibet must evolve. We cannot rely solely on past narratives of suffering; we must also highlight our contributions to the world. Tibetans in exile have built schools, preserved culture and become bridges between the East and West. Our monastic universities in India continue to train thousands in Buddhist philosophy. Our artists, writers and musicians are reviving Tibetan identity in dynamic, creative ways. In advocating for Tibet, we are not merely asking for freedom; we are offering the world an alternative vision, one that values compassion over conquest, spiritual growth over materialism. In my interactions with non-Tibetans, be it fellow students, activists or global citizens, I often sense genuine curiosity but also deep ignorance about Tibet. Many see the Dalai Lama as a symbol of peace but know little about the tragedy that exiled him. Global advocacy must therefore begin with education. The world must learn our history, not from the lens of Chinese propaganda but from the testimonies of Tibetan voices, refugees, monks, writers and youth. Only when people understand the truth can they be moved to care. And only when they care can change begin.   I believe that young Tibetans like me must take greater ownership of this advocacy. Our parents preserved our heritage in exile; now it is our turn to project it into the future. We must harness the tools of the digital age i.e. social media, storytelling, art and activism; to bring the Tibetan narrative into global consciousness. We must collaborate with other oppressed communities, recognizing that our struggle is part of a larger tapestry of human rights violations. Solidarity is not charity; it is a shared resistance against systems of oppression. But the responsibility is not ours alone. I call upon the international community, especially democratic nations and human rights institutions to do more than issue statements. Real advocacy means applying pressure, demanding transparency and supporting grassroots movements. It means granting political asylum to Tibetan refugees, funding cultural preservation initiatives and standing firm against the normalization of oppression in the name of diplomacy. To be silent in the face of genocide, cultural or physical is to be complicit. As I write this, I again reminded of a phrase which I heard through my grandparents "བོད་མི་འབྱོར་བ་མེད། ང་ཚོས་བོད་སྐྱོན་མེད་ན།" (Tibet is not lost unless we forget it).  Her words have stayed with me like a mantra. They remind me that as long as we remember, speak and act, the dream of a free Tibet lives on. The Snow Mountains may seem distant, but their spirit is alive in every child who learns Tibetan, every elder who lights a butter lamp and every activist who dares to raise their voice. 
      In conclusion, global advocacy for Tibet must be more than a campaign. It must be a conscience. It is about justice, memory and the unyielding belief that truth, no matter how suppressed, will rise. As an Indian Tibetan exile, I carry both the weight and the blessing of this dual identity. It is a burden shaped by loss, but also a gift shaped by resilience. I do not know if I will ever see a free Tibet, but I do know this; I will not stop speaking for it, dreaming of it and working toward it. And I hope, with all the strength of my exile-born soul, that the world will one day listen, not just with sympathy but, with solidarity.
