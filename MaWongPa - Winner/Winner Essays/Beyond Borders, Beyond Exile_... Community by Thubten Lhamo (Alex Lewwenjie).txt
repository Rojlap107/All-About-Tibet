Beyond Borders, Beyond Exile: Building Bridges Between the Tibetan Diaspora in 
Singapore and the Exile Community 

Though small in number, the Tibetan community in Singapore sits at a unique 
crossroads—geographically close to South Asia, politically situated in a neutral and globally 
connected state, and culturally tied to both the exile movement and the wider Tibetan 
diaspora. Singapore, a global city built on migration and diversity, is an unlikely yet promising 
node in the web of Tibetan displacement. From monks quietly continuing their spiritual duties 
in Little India to young Tibetan scholars in universities, there exists in Singapore a modest 
but resilient Tibetan presence. These individuals, often living far from the heartlands of exile 
settlements in India and Nepal, nonetheless carry with them the same burden of memory, 
the same yearning for cultural preservation, and the same call to justice. In this essay, I 
argue that this community—though small—has the potential to play a critical role in forging 
deeper ties with exile Tibetans, offering new forms of collaboration rooted in solidarity, 
mentorship, and shared vision. 

In many ways, Singapore reflects the paradoxes of the Tibetan experience in the diaspora: 
proximity to the homeland but political distance from it; a highly educated and connected 
youth, but often emotionally or structurally disconnected from exile institutions; a freedom to 
organize, but within the bounds of geopolitical sensitivities. These conditions mean that any 
attempt to build bridges must be both intentional and imaginative. It is not enough to 
passively consume news of Tibetan struggles abroad or to light butter lamps in memory of 
those in Tibet. We must take active steps to reach out, learn from, and work with those in 
exile who have spent their lives preserving our language, religion, and national identity under 
the most difficult circumstances. 

A first step toward building bridges is creating platforms for direct engagement. There are 
many young Tibetans in Singapore—students on scholarships, professionals in healthcare or 
business, and children of earlier migrants—who possess skills, access, and networks that 
could greatly benefit exile communities. At the same time, many Tibetan youth in exile face 
barriers in accessing quality education, global mentorship, and opportunities for creative 
expression. Why should these two worlds remain strangers to each other? Imagine if 
students in Singapore volunteered during school breaks to run creative writing workshops at 
Tibetan Children’s Villages, or if professionals mentored high school graduates in Bylakuppe 
or Dharamshala in navigating career paths in science, tech, or public policy. These need not 
be abstract dreams. With proper coordination—perhaps facilitated by a youth-led Tibetan 
association in Singapore or through online platforms—such knowledge exchange could 
become an annual tradition, embedded in the rhythms of Tibetan community life. 

Yet collaboration cannot be one-directional. It must begin with humility and listening. The 
exile communities in India and Nepal have endured great hardship, building robust social, 
cultural, and political institutions over the decades. They are not merely recipients of help; 
they are centers of leadership and creativity. Any relationship must be reciprocal and rooted 
in mutual learning. Tibetans in Singapore can learn deeply from the resilience and cultural 
depth of these communities—through visits, cultural exchanges, or joint art and storytelling 
projects that bridge the different experiences of being Tibetan. Imagine collaborative 
podcasts featuring youth voices from both exile settlements and the Singaporean diaspora, 



or virtual reading circles where participants discuss Tibetan literature, history, and identity 
together across borders. 

Singapore’s infrastructure and digital connectivity also open the door to more sustained 
forms of mentorship. Rather than one-off charity drives or symbolic gestures, Tibetans in 
Singapore can commit to long-term mentorship networks—offering guidance on university 
applications, job placements, or even global advocacy opportunities. Many youth in exile 
want to engage internationally but lack access to the soft skills or insider knowledge needed 
to break into competitive spaces. A monthly call, an edited essay, a contact passed 
along—these small acts can create ripples of change in young lives. In return, mentors can 
gain a renewed sense of purpose, a deeper connection to the Tibetan struggle, and a shared 
identity that is not bounded by geography but by intention. 

At the same time, we must not ignore the broader political realities in which these 
collaborations take place. Singapore, while open in many respects, maintains a cautious 
foreign policy and rarely takes public stances on politically sensitive issues such as Tibet. 
This makes direct activism more difficult—but it also challenges us to think creatively. 
Cultural diplomacy, art exhibitions, interfaith dialogues, and youth storytelling festivals are all 
legitimate ways of keeping the Tibetan issue alive without triggering unnecessary backlash. 
Such events can also be spaces of collaboration—bringing speakers, artists, and educators 
from exile communities to share their work in Singapore, and opening space for mutual 
visibility and recognition. These events may not change governments, but they can change 
minds—and in a globalized world, changing minds is often the first step to changing 
structures. 

Financially, too, the diaspora has a role to play—but again, not just through donations. 
Instead of framing support as charity, we can think of it as investment—investment in shared 
futures, in education, in social enterprise, in youth leadership. Tibetan cooperatives in India 
or Nepal could be supported through ethical buying programs in Singapore; student 
scholarships could be crowd-funded and sustained by diaspora families; monasteries or 
community centers could receive tech upgrades through pooled donations coordinated 
digitally. The key is transparency, accountability, and a clear narrative of partnership. People 
are more likely to give when they feel part of something meaningful—and being Tibetan 
should be the strongest bond of meaning we have. 

None of this is without challenges. There remain trust gaps between some in exile and some 
in the diaspora, shaped by decades of distance and different life experiences. There are 
infrastructural limitations, like internet access in settlements, and legal constraints on 
organizing in certain countries. But none of these challenges are insurmountable. If we begin 
with empathy, build slowly, and center relationships before results, we can overcome these 
barriers. The bridges we need to build are not made of policy alone—they are made of 
people, and people are capable of incredible things when given a chance to connect. 

For too long, diaspora and exile have been seen as parallel lines—similar, but never 
intersecting. But the future demands convergence. The Tibetan movement will not survive on 
memory alone. It needs fresh energy, transnational thinking, and new forms of solidarity that 
reach across oceans and languages. The young Tibetan in Singapore and the young Tibetan 



in Nepal are not strangers—they are siblings of a shared story, and it is time they began 
writing the next chapter together. 

In closing, I offer this essay not as an expert or spokesperson, but as one voice in a global 
chorus of Tibetans who believe in the power of unity, creativity, and collective action. May 
this voice spark others. May our bridges be many. And may our struggle—rooted in 
compassion, truth, and resilience—continue until Tibet is free and all Tibetans, wherever 
they are, can live with dignity, purpose, and peace.
