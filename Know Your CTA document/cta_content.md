### Tibetan Supreme Justice Commission (TSJC)
[https://trimzin.net/](https://trimzin.net/)

The Tibetan Supreme Justice Commission (TSJC) is the highest judicial authority of the Central Tibetan Administration. It is responsible for upholding the rule of law, interpreting Tibetan laws, and ensuring justice within the Tibetan exile community. Functioning independently from the executive (Kashag) and legislative (Parliament) branches, the TSJC safeguards judicial independence and ensures that legal processes remain fair, impartial, and consistent with democratic principles and Tibetan values.

**Justice Secretariat**
The Justice Secretariat serves as the administrative and operational backbone of the TSJC. It supports the Commission by managing case documentation, coordinating hearings, maintaining judicial records, and facilitating communication between different justice bodies under the Tibetan judicial system. The Secretariat ensures the smooth functioning of the courts and assists in implementing judicial decisions.

**Tibetan Circuit Justice Commission (TCJC)**
The Tibetan Circuit Justice Commission (TCJC) operates as a mobile judicial body under the TSJC. Its primary role is to bring justice closer to Tibetan communities by conducting hearings directly in settlements and regions that are geographically distant from the central judiciary. This system ensures access to justice for all Tibetans in exile, regardless of location, and helps resolve civil disputes in a timely and accessible manner.

*   **TCJC – Dekyiling:** The TCJC at Dekyiling functions as a regional base for circuit justice activities in North India. From this location, the Circuit Justice Commission conducts hearings and judicial proceedings for nearby Tibetan settlements, reducing the burden on litigants who would otherwise need to travel long distances for legal redress.

**Tibetan Local Justice Commission (TLJC)**
The Tibetan Local Justice Commission (TLJC) handles minor civil disputes, mediation, and community-level legal matters. Emphasizing reconciliation and amicable settlement, the TLJC plays an important role in maintaining harmony within Tibetan communities by resolving conflicts at the grassroots level, often using mediation informed by Tibetan customary practices.

*   **TLJC – Northern Region (Dekyiling):** The Northern Region TLJC, based in Dekyiling, serves Tibetan settlements across North India. It addresses local disputes and minor legal cases, providing accessible justice and mediation services within the community.
*   **TLJC – Southern Region (Bylakuppe):** The Southern Region TLJC, located in Bylakuppe, caters to one of the largest Tibetan settlement areas in South India. It plays a crucial role in resolving community disputes and maintaining social harmony among a large resident population.
*   **TLJC – Southern Region (Ladakh):** The TLJC in Ladakh serves Tibetan communities living in the Ladakh region. It addresses local justice needs while taking into account the unique geographic, cultural, and social context of Tibetans living in this high-altitude border region.

### Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile (TPIE)
[https://tibetanparliament.org/](https://tibetanparliament.org/)

The Tibetan Parliament-in Exile (TPiE) is the unicameral legislative body and highest representative institution of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA)—the democratically elected government of Tibetans living in exile. It embodies the democratic aspirations of the global Tibetan community and functions as a central pillar of Tibetan governance alongside the Judiciary and Executive.

Established as part of the democratic structures developed by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Parliament in Exile evolved from early representative bodies into a fully modern legislature. Democratic governance in exile began soon after the Tibetan government was reconstituted in India following the 1959 uprising and subsequent exile, with formal legislative powers progressively strengthened through the Charter of the Tibetans in Exile.

The Parliament sits in Dharamshala, India, in the foothills of the Himalayas, a place often referred to as “Little Lhasa”. Its position in exile underscores both the ongoing Tibetan struggle for freedom and the resilience of its democratic institutions.

The 17th Tibetan Parliament in Exile comprises 45 members from across the Tibetan diaspora. Representatives include ten members each from the three traditional provinces of Tibet (Ü-Tsang, Kham, and Amdo), members from the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism and the Bon religion, and representatives of Tibetans living in North America, Europe, Australasia, and other regions. This structure ensures both cultural diversity and geographic representation within the legislature.

Parliamentarians elect among themselves a Speaker and Deputy Speaker to preside over sessions. Elections are held every five years, with all Tibetans in exile aged 18 and above eligible to vote and those aged 25 and above eligible to contest. Sessions are typically convened bi-annually.

The TPiE has several key responsibilities within the Central Tibetan Administration:
*   Legislative authority: to enact laws, frame rules and regulations, and amend policies in accordance with the Charter of the Tibetans in Exile.
*   Oversight: to supervise the administration’s finances and public expenditure.
*   Advocacy and Liaison: to engage with governments, parliaments, NGOs and civil society worldwide to garner support for the Tibetan cause and international advocacy.
*   Representation: to bring the concerns and aspirations of the global Tibetan diaspora into policy debates at the highest level.

Despite operating in exile, the Tibetan Parliament continues to uphold democratic norms and processes, reflecting the enduring commitment of the Tibetan people to self-governance, freedom, and non-violent advocacy. Its activities extend beyond law-making to include cultural preservation, community outreach, and international diplomacy.

**Parliamentary Secretariat**
The Parliament Secretariat is the administrative and operational backbone of the Tibetan Parliament‑in‑Exile, responsible for ensuring the smooth functioning, continuity, and institutional integrity of the Parliament. While the Members of Parliament (MPs) serve as elected representatives, the Secretariat provides the professional, non-partisan support that enables Parliament to discharge its constitutional and democratic responsibilities effectively.

It functions as the permanent administrative body of the TPiE. Its core mandate is to assist the Parliament in carrying out its legislative, oversight, and representative functions in accordance with the Charter of the Tibetans in Exile. The Secretariat ensures that parliamentary procedures, records, and decisions are properly managed, preserved, and implemented.

Key Functions and Responsibilities:
*   Legislative and Session Support: The Secretariat organizes and manages all parliamentary sessions, including budget sessions and general sessions.
*   Administrative and Institutional Management: It oversees day-to-day administrative affairs of the Parliament, including human resources, office management, and coordination with other organs of the CTA.
*   Documentation and Archival Work: Maintenance of parliamentary records—laws passed, debates held, committee reports, and official correspondence.
*   Committee Coordination: Logistical and research support to various parliamentary committees.
*   Liaison and Communication: Bridge between MPs, the Kashag (Cabinet), CTA departments, and external stakeholders.
*   Public Information and Transparency: Supports the publication of parliamentary information.

The Parliament Secretariat operates under the authority of the Speaker of the TPiE. It is headed by a Secretary-level official and staffed by civil servants.

**Local Tibetan Assemblies – 40 Locations**
Grassroots democratic institutions functioning under the authority of the TPiE. Spread across 40 locations in Tibetan Settlements, these assemblies serve as the local representative bodies of the Tibetan people in exile.

**Tibetan Freedom Movement Sub-Committees (BRDL) – 148 Locations**
Function in 148 locations worldwide. These committees mobilize Tibetans and supporters for advocacy, awareness campaigns, commemorative events, and democratic engagement. They also support the grassroots collection of the Tibetan Chatrel contributions.

### Kashag (Cabinet)
[tibet.net](https://tibet.net)

The Kashag is the executive branch of the Central Tibetan Administration and is responsible for the day-to-day governance and administration of the Tibetan community in exile. It is headed by the Sikyong, who serves as the political leader and head of the executive. The Kashag consists of seven Kalons (Cabinet Ministers), each responsible for overseeing one or more CTA departments.

The Sikyong is democratically elected by Tibetans in exile for a five-year term. The most recent Sikyong election was held in 2021, and the next election cycle is scheduled for 2026. As head of the executive, the Sikyong provides overall leadership, policy direction, and representation of the Tibetan people at national and international levels.

After assuming office, the Sikyong nominates the seven Kalons, selecting individuals based on experience, expertise, and suitability for ministerial responsibility. These nominations are then presented to the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile for approval. Each nominated Kalon must receive a majority vote in Parliament to be formally appointed. This process ensures democratic oversight of the executive, balances executive authority with legislative scrutiny, and reinforces accountability within the Tibetan democratic system.

The Kashag functions collectively, with decisions taken through consultation and shared responsibility. It is accountable to the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile and can be questioned, reviewed, or held responsible through parliamentary procedures, reflecting the checks and balances built into Tibetan democratic governance.

**Kashag Secretariat**
The Kashag Secretariat is the central administrative unit that supports the functioning of the executive branch. It assists the Kashag by managing official correspondence, preparing agendas and documentation for cabinet meetings, recording decisions, and coordinating follow-up actions across CTA departments. The Secretariat plays a critical role in ensuring continuity, coordination, and effective implementation of executive policies, and serves as the primary institutional link between the Kashag, Parliament, and other constitutional bodies.
