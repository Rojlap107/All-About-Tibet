General --- are elected by the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile**. This
process ensures that these bodies remain **independent of the executive
branch (Kashag)** while still being democratically accountable to the
elected legislature.

By vesting the power of election in the Parliament, the Tibetan
democratic system strengthens **institutional independence, checks and
balances, and public trust**. Once elected, the heads of these bodies
function autonomously and are expected to carry out their duties
impartially, without political interference.

## Election Commission

The **Election Commission** is responsible for **conducting free, fair,
and transparent elections** for all major Tibetan democratic
institutions. This includes elections for the **Sikyong**, **Tibetan
Parliament-in-Exile**, and **Local Tibetan Assemblies**.

The Commission prepares electoral rules, manages voter registration,
oversees nomination processes, conducts polling, and declares results.
It also addresses electoral complaints and disputes to ensure
credibility and public trust in the democratic process. By operating
independently from political influence, the Election Commission
safeguards the legitimacy of Tibetan self-governance and democratic
continuity in exile.

## Public Service Commission (PSC)

The **Public Service Commission (PSC)** is responsible for the
**recruitment, examination, and appointment of civil servants** within
the CTA. Its primary mandate is to ensure that CTA staffing is based on
**merit, fairness, and transparency**, rather than political influence
or favoritism.

The PSC conducts competitive examinations, interviews, and selection
processes for various grades of CTA service. It also advises on service
rules, promotions, and disciplinary matters. By maintaining a
professional and impartial civil service, the PSC strengthens
institutional capacity and ensures continuity and efficiency in CTA
administration.

## Office of the Auditor General

The **Office of the Auditor General** is the highest financial oversight
authority of the CTA. Its role is to **audit accounts, review financial
management, and ensure accountability and transparency** across all CTA
departments, offices, and affiliated institutions.

The Auditor General examines whether public funds are used according to
approved budgets, financial rules, and established procedures. Audit
reports are submitted to the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile, enabling
legislative oversight of public spending. Through independent auditing
and reporting, this office helps prevent misuse of funds, strengthens
financial discipline, and builds public confidence in CTA institutions.
